# M2.2

If you look at the Reference picture you can see what I was kind of going for with our lab. I did the whole thing while using the live browser and did not open in another browser like google so the proportions are a little bit off on google so let me know if you have any ideas on how I could fix that. I also couldn't get the border to look quite right so it would also be nice for a push in the right direction there as well.


## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository and run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
```
This will install the necessary dependencies for the project.

## Development

It is recommended to use the VSCode Live Server extension to run the project
locally. This will allow you to see changes in real-time as you make them. There
is no need to run a build process or refresh the page manually. Additionally,
you do not need to setup a local server to run the project.

## Testing

To run the tests for the project, run the following command:

```bash
npm test
```
